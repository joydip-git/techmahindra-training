1. variables
2. types of data
3. operators
4. statements
5. function - declaration + expression
6. object creation: literal syntax + constructor function

7. internals:
	a. execution context
	b. stages: i. compilation stage ii. execution stage
	c. variable hositing + function hoisting
	d. this keyword
	e. context binding - bind(), apply(), arrow function (ES6)

8. architectural: 3-tier architecture (modularize)


1. code needs to be modular (logical) -- done
2. physical separation -- done
3. interconnect all the files (NOT linking all files to *.html file)
	concept: module concept in JS
4. app to run in 
	a. browser
	b. non-browser

A.
Node JS, Node runtime, packages, JS engine

1. creating application structure
2. using tools for 
	a. transpilation of code
	b. creating production + development code
	c. during development how to host in a dev-server


i. Module in JS:
----------------------------------
	a single JS/TS/NS file === module
	Node runtime creates an object to represent the file loaded in Node runtime=> module object

ii. how to create a module and mention which members are exportable???
	Module Formats: 
	a. CommonJS (used by Node by default)
			--> module.exports, require()
	b. AMD (asynchronous module definition)
	c. UMD (Universal module definition)
	d. ES6 (import, export) --- 2015

iii. module-loader
----------------------------
understands module format and resolves dependencies amongst the files and load the files accordingly
Node runtime has default common js module loader
'module'

	commonjs
	requirejs

2015
JS new features:
	a. let
	b. const
	c. arrow function
	d. class - constructor, properties (value properties), methods (functional properties), getter-setter (get/set)
	e. templated string/string interpolation
	f. spread operator
	g. object destructuring


1. browser runtime (unlike node runtime) is unable to understand require() method
	answer: browser runtime does not support module feature and does not have any module loader hence
	solution: supply a module-loader=> requirejs

2. will the new features be supported in older browser?
3. should i always use CommonJS format for defining module exports and imports i browser-centric app?
	answer: use whichever you like, BUT supply only AMD format module code to browser, IF YOU ARE USING REQUIRE JS as module loader for browser

4. apart from lite-server, do i have better dev-server
5. is there a performance issue w.r.t my app?
	-- create package (prod/dev) and then load into the browser
