ECMAScript
javascript + typescript

basic
prototype based programming in JS
this and lexical scope
promises
hoisting - variable + function

execution context

ES6--ES10

JS/TS HTML??? No

JS runtime out of browser
Node JS 
Express JS

application structure and tools required


front end:
	React JS framework - Next JS
		State management: Redux

backend server (RESTFul API)- Nest JS - a. Express b. Fastify
	TypeORM/mongoose
	
	WebSocket/GRPC

backend -- postgresql/mongodb

JS execution:

a. Preparation stage
b. execution stage

1. execution context: (EC)
	- global execution: at the beginning (always)
	- any function execution context (when the function is called)
2. execution context stack (ECS):
	- a stakc data structure where the ECs are stored at the top of each other. the topomost EC will be removed first

3. Execution Context Object:
	- this: refers to the "owner" of the global function/function
		- browser runtime: window (be default)
		- node runtime: global (by default)

	- scope: access to all the variables of the current and other scopes
	- variables: the variables/function declartions part of the current scope
		- variable and functional hoisting
4. this keyword: bind() method, arrow function (ES6 style)
5. object creation:
	a. object literal
	b. function constructor

6. modularity
